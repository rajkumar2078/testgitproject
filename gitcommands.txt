Git commands:

	Basic Commands:		1. git config --list  ⇒ list all the settings Git can find at that point		2. git help config ⇒ help for any of the Git commands.
		3. man git -config ⇒ get the manpage help for the config command.

	Initialize new repository:
		4. git init ⇒ it will create .git that contains all of your necessary repos- itory files — a Git repository skeleton.
		5. git add *.c
		6. git add README
		7. git commit m ’initial project version’
		
	Clone Existing Repository:
		8. git clone <url> ⇒ 
				Git receives a copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is 					pulled down.In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can use any of the clones on any client to set the server back to 				the state it was in when it was cloned.
			
			e.g., : git clone git://github.com/schacon/grit.git
				That creates a directory named “grit”, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and 				checks out a working copy of the latest ver- sion
